        <p>Recently, I came across a quote that immediately stood out to me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t like to write, but I take great pleasure in having written. <br />
– William Zisser (Write to Learn)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t consider myself a writer, but I know this feeling all too well:
I don’t like to work out, but I take great pleasure in having worked out.
I don’t like to get up early in the morning, but I take great pleasure in starting my day early.</p>

<p>Sometimes, the opposite is just as true:
I do like to eat sweets, but I regret having eaten them.
I do like to gossip, but I despise having gossiped.
I do like to procrastinate, but I despise having so many tasks left undone.</p>

<p>It’s same question every time:
<em>Do you overcome the obstacle in the current moment, or do you give in and seek immediate pleasure?</em>
The more time there is between challenge and delayed gratification, the harder it is to withstand the temptation to give in.
Getting up early in the morning for instance, is easy because as soon as I sit in my armchair 15 minutes later, starting my day reading a book in silence, dimmed lights in the living room while the sun slowly rises, I remember it was totally worth it.</p>

<p>Other things, like working out for example, require more willpower and discipline.
It’s not only hard to convince yourself to do it in the first place. 
Sometimes it feels awful
you might regret it while doing it and finishing it doesn’t help that much either.
Working out might be a bad example because endorphins flood your body afterwards 
However, there a challenges where the only reward in the moment after the challenge is the thought of having done the right thing.
Even if it doesn’t feel like it.</p>

<!--- goggins: I brainwashed myself into craving discomfort -->
<p>The one things that helps are systems and habits.
The goal is to not be challenged in the first place.</p>

<p>Things like working out often require more willpower or self-disciplie because I don’t see immediate benefits.
Sometimes it helps thinking about what the future-me would think about it.
Would it be indifferent about the choice in the moment, would it be in favour or strongly against what I’m considering to do?</p>
