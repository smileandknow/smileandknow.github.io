  <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently I came across a quote that immediately stood out at me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I don’t like to write, but I take great pleasure in having written &lt;br /&gt;
– William Zisser (Write to Learn)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I don’t consider myself a writer, I know this feeling all too well:
I don’t like to work out, but I take great pleasure in having worked out.
I don’t like to get up early in the morning, but I take great pleasure in having gotten up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the opposite is just as true:
I do like to eat sweets, but I despise having eaten them.
I do like to gossip, but I despise having gossiped.
I do like to procrastinate, but I despise having so many tasks left undone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s about overcoming the obstacle in the moment to eventually enjoy the delayed gratifaction.
In some cases, it’s easy to “do what is good” for me because the delayed gratification is actually not too far down the line:
Getting up in the morning for instance, simply requires getting up once the alarm rings.
As soon as I sit in my living room chair 15 minutes later, starting my day reading a book in silence, I remember why it is worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things like working out often require more willpower or self-disciplie because I don’t see immediate benefits.
Sometimes it helps thinking about what the future-me would think about it.
Would it be indifferent about the choice in the moment, would it be in favour or strongly against what I’m considering to do?&lt;/p&gt;

Assume your next hour is completely free and you've got no urgent tasks to take care of. 
How do you spend it? 
Do you pick up a book? 
Do you listen to a podcast? 
Do you browse the latest headlines? 
Or instead, do you learn to cook something for sharing it with loved ones? 
Do you start working on this project you've been postponing? 
Do you create or do you consume?

One end of this spectrum is unreachable: 
One cannot create without ever consuming. 
However on the other end, there are black holes: 
people who endlessly take in everything without returning, that is creating, anything. 
I'm a black hole. This is my attempt to change this.

It's about what and how much to take in versus how to procees and what to make of it. 
Regardless of how mindfully one chooses what to consume, the ratio stays the same as long as there's nothing actively created. 
The emphasis is on &quot;actively&quot;. 
Obviously my consumption greatly influences me personally. 
By extension it then also somewhat affects the people close to me. 
One could argue that me influencing others this way is already creating something in someone.

However, this active way of consuming but passive way of &quot;creating&quot; seems unbalanced and feeds an increasing urge to create something as actively and as mindfully as I consume. 
This is it. 
This is my collection of thoughts.
