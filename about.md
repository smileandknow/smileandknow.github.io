This is a random collection of articles.
Every article is purely written with me as the target audience in mind.
If you find anything valuable in here, it's completely accidental.

### The Name
I came across the name reading the last chapter of the book "The Top Five Regrets of the Dying" by Bronnie Ware.
An impressive book about a woman taking care of the elderly, writing down their life regrets.
Eventually, she became depressive herself and found these words to give her hope for better days to come.

Smile and know, there are bright days ahead.
