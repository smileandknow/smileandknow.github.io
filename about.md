This is a random collection of things articles, quotes and questions.
If you find anything valuable in here, it's completely accidental because it's meant to be for myself.

### The Name
I came across the name reading the last chapter of the book "The Top Five Regrets of the Dying" by Bronnie Ware.
An impressive book about a woman taking care of the elderly, writing down their life regrets.
Eventually she became depressive and found these words to remind her that there are always brighter days ahead.

Smile and Know.
