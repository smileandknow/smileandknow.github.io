Let me oversimplify and say that there are two kinds of tasks you're dealing with everyday.
Task that maintain things and tasks that allow you to progress.

Tasks that maintain things tend to be recurring and restore the order.
I think about thinks like washing clothes, cleaning up the kitchen, taking trash out etc.
They maintain a certain order and just have to done.

Progressive tasks however, make somethings better instead of restoring the old status.
Progressive tasks improve something in a way that makes it a certain bit better than it was yesterday.
I think about things like putting up a new shelf or planting something in your garden.
