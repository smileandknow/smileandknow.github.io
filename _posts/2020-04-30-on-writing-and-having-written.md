<!--- Recently, I came across a quote that immediately stood out to me:  -->

> I don’t like to write, but I take great pleasure in having written. <br>
> – William Zisser (Writing to Learn)

I don't consider myself a writer, but I know this feeling all too well:
I don't like to work out, but I take great pleasure in having worked out.
I don't like to get up early in the morning, but I take great pleasure in starting my day early.

Sometimes, the opposite is just as true:
I do like to eat sweets, but I regret having eaten them.
I do like to gossip, but I despise having gossiped.
I do like to procrastinate, but I loathe having many tasks left undone.

It's the same question every time:

*Do you overcome the obstacle in the current moment, or do you give in and seek immediate pleasure?*

The more time there is between challenge and delayed gratification, the harder it is to withstand the temptation to give in.
Getting up early in the morning for instance, is easy because as soon as I sit in my armchair 15 minutes later, starting my day reading a book in silence with dimmed lights in the living room while the sun slowly rises outside, I remember it was totally worth it.

Other challenges require more willpower and discipline.
Working out for example, is a lasting and recurrent challenge that is physically exhausting - by definition.
It is tiring in the moment, leaves you exhausted, and rewards you with an aching body the next day.
To make matters worse, it takes consistency over an extended period of time in order to see the results.
Without endorphins flooding your body after exercising, it would be torturous to keep up with a consistent exercise routine.
Nevertheless, there are challenges where the only immediate reward is the thought of having done "the right thing".

The key to not giving in is to not be challenged in the first place.

Setting up systems, routines, and habits allows to mindlessly do what you set yourself up to.
Work out the same time every day, be it first thing in the morning or immediately after work, no matter what.
Make all important things opt-out in the calendar.
Try Matt D'Avella's [Two Day Rule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfLHTLQZ5nc) where you're allowed to skip one day but never two in a row.
Make it a question about identity rather than the action:
Are you simply the person who avoids eating processed sugar in general, or do you constantly use willpower to actively decide against it in the moment? 
Figure out what works for you.

Eventually it's about finding something to blame.
It's about avoiding the need to decide because something has already decided for you:
"Sorry, I've got to work out today since I already skipped yesterday and I'm following the two day rule".
"It's 5am - time to meditate like I do every day", or "Desert? No thanks, I'm avoiding processed sugars."
Oh, and please don't say it out loud. 
You don't want to be someone preaching his personal system to everyone else without having been asked.

It's not gonna be easy and there will be multiple setbacks, but
