Recently, I came across a quote that immediately stood out to me: 

> I don’t like to write, but I take great pleasure in having written <br>
> – William Zisser (Write to Learn)

Even though I don't consider myself a writer, I know this feeling all too well:
I don't like to work out, but I take great pleasure in having worked out.
I don't like to get up early in the morning, but I take great pleasure in starting my day early.

Sometimes, the opposite is just as true:
I do like to eat sweets, but I regret having eaten them.
I do like to gossip, but I despise having gossiped.
I do like to procrastinate, but I despise having so many tasks left undone.

It's about overcoming the obstacle in the moment to eventually enjoy the delayed gratification.
In some cases, it's easy to "do what is good" because the delayed gratification is actually not too far down the line:
Getting up in the morning for instance, "simply" requires standing up once the alarm rings.
As soon as I sit in my comfortable living room 15 minutes later, starting my day reading a book in silence with dimmed lights while slowly watching the sun rise, I remember why it is worth it.

Things like working out often require more willpower or self-disciplie because I don't see immediate benefits.
Sometimes it helps thinking about what the future-me would think about it.
Would it be indifferent about the choice in the moment, would it be in favour or strongly against what I'm considering to do?
