Assume your next hour is completely free and you've got no urgent tasks to take care of. 
How do you spend it? 
Do you pick up a book? 
Do you listen to a podcast? 
Do you browse the latest headlines? 
Or instead, do you learn to cook something for sharing it with loved ones? 
Do you start working on this project you've been postponing? 

*Do you create or do you consume?*

There's a ration between how much you consume and how much you create.
One end of this spectrum is unreachable: 
You cannot create without ever consuming. 
However on the other end, there are people who endlessly consume without ever creating anything to be consumed by others.
I tend to find myself on the latter end of this spectrum.

It's about what and how much you consume versus how to process and what to make of it.
Sometimes, my default behavior - constantly consuming one book and podcast after the other - makes me think of myself as a black hole.
I'm endlessly taking in other peoples thoughts, ideas, perspectives and experiences without ever letting any of mine escape. 
This is my attempt to change this.

Regardless of how mindfully I choose what to consume, the ratio stays the same as long as there's nothing actively created. 
The emphasis is on "actively". 
Obviously my consumption influences me personally. 
By extension it then also somewhat affects the people close to me. 
One could argue that me influencing others this way is already creating something in someone.
However, this active way of consuming but passive way of "creating" seems unbalanced to me. 
It feeds an increasing urge to create something as actively and as mindfully as I consume - even if I'm the only one consuming it again.
