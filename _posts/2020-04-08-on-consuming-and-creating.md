One end of this spectrum is unreachable: 
One cannot create without ever consuming. 
However on the other end, there are black holes: 
people who endlessly take in everything without returning, that is creating, anything. 
I'm a black hole. This is my attempt to change this.

It's about what and how much to take in versus how to procees and what to make of it. 
Regardless of how mindfully one chooses what to consume, the ratio stays the same as long as there's nothing actively created. 
The emphasis is on "actively". 
Obviously my consumption greatly influences me personally. 
By extension it then also somewhat affects the people close to me. 
One could argue that me influencing others this way is already creating something in someone.

However, this active way of consuming but passive way of "creating" seems unbalanced and feeds an increasing urge to create something as actively and as mindfully as I consume. 
This is it. 
This is my collection of thoughts.
