This is a list of things I ask myself. 
The goal is trying to find short answer to topics I have incomplete knowledge about.
Every now and then, I'll invest a cup of coffee (or about 30 minutes) to pick a question and try to find an answer that I find satisfying.

At least that's the plan.

* What is _Probabilistic Programming_?
* What is _Polyhedral Compilation_?
